# Strategy Builder UI

A gamified drag-and-drop interface for building custom stock trading strategy pipelines. This UI runs on port 3001 and provides a mobile-friendly, engaging experience for creating and executing multi-strategy trading pipelines.

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Gamified Interface
- Drag-and-drop strategy sequencing
- Visual pipeline builder with smooth animations
- Real-time feedback and progress indicators
- Mobile-responsive design

### ðŸ”§ Strategy Configuration
- Market cap limit configuration for each strategy
- Output count settings (how many stocks to pass to next strategy)
- Industry and sector filtering options
- Real-time parameter validation

### ðŸ“Š Pipeline Execution
- Sequential strategy execution
- Detailed execution metrics and timing
- Stock flow visualization through pipeline
- Performance analytics for each strategy

### ðŸ“± Mobile & Web Support
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Optimized for mobile trading workflows

## Available Strategies

1. **Momentum Strategy** - Identifies stocks with strong price momentum using the Frog in the Pan methodology
2. **52-Week Breakout** - Finds stocks breaking out to new 52-week highs with strong volume
3. **Mean Reversion** - Identifies oversold stocks that may bounce back to their mean
4. **Low Volatility** - Finds stocks with low price volatility for stable returns

## How It Works

1. **Build Pipeline**: Drag strategies from the available list to create your custom pipeline
2. **Configure Strategies**: Set market cap limits, output counts, and filters for each strategy
3. **Execute Pipeline**: Run the pipeline to see how stocks flow through each strategy
4. **Analyze Results**: View detailed execution metrics and final stock portfolio

## Pipeline Flow

```
Market Cap Universe â†’ Strategy 1 â†’ Strategy 2 â†’ Strategy 3 â†’ Final Portfolio
     (1000 stocks)    (500 stocks)  (100 stocks)  (20 stocks)   (20 stocks)
```

Each strategy:
- Takes input stocks from the previous strategy (or market cap universe for first strategy)
- Applies its specific logic and scoring
- Outputs the top N stocks based on its criteria
- Passes results to the next strategy in the pipeline

## API Endpoints

The UI communicates with the backend through these endpoints:

- `GET /strategies` - Get available strategies
- `POST /pipeline/execute` - Execute a strategy pipeline
- `GET /pipeline/{id}` - Get pipeline execution results
- `POST /pipeline/save` - Save pipeline configuration
- `GET /pipeline/saved` - Get saved pipelines
- `GET /industries` - Get available industries
- `GET /sectors` - Get available sectors

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
cd frontend-strategy-builder

## Docker Deployment

The UI is containerized and runs on port 3001:

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose-microservices.yml up --build strategy-builder

# Or run standalone
docker build -t strategy-builder .
docker run -p 3001:3001 strategy-builder
```
